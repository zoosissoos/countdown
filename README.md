# web-scraper

This is a React countdown application. A user enters a date in "Month Day, year" Format and the countdown will determine how much time is left for the selected date. 

## Getting Started

To get running locally you will have to follow install directions below

### Prerequisites/Technologies Used

react.js
react-bootstrap

### Installing

- Clone into desired location
- 'cd' into main directory of project
- run 'yarn start' and visit localhost in browser.



### Future development

I wish to add form validation to the date input so the user does not have to be concerned with date format. 

## Deployment

This has not been deployed
